This website is labelled as the worlds most secure website. They have an example login
credential guest:guest. Theres no sign up page. On the home screen theres a note posted by
the admin saying, "We recently fixed a bug where users who weren't logged in would be able
to view the profile page of any user on the site. Let us know if the fix causes any 
problems.". On the home page theres also a bunch articles under a News heading. After
viewing the source of the home page I saw that urls for those pages were directing to 
/new/1 all the way till /new/7. Only the /new/6 was not there which told me that there 
might something in /new/6 and after going in there was a flag on

CTF{DeletedButN0tG0n3}

The website also has /profile page and the directory following that was guest, so it was 
basically /profile/guest so I assume the format follows as /profile/user. Given there was
already a user named admin I tried accesing the /profile/admin which had a flag.

CTF{WhatDoesIDORMean?}

On the website theres seems to be a /send page that is meant to "Send secret message". In 
the page theres a place to enter the username to send the message, the input for the message
and a secret ID. When the secret ID is clicked to display one of the IDs appear to be:

0fa199bac11f45fa5a544f8fad31019fada12c2394a45ba7be88604a1017a63d

After viewing the source I see that there is some javascript that generates a SHA3-256 hash.
This hash is applied to the secret ID. Judging from te secretID field it seems that the hashes
are generated from a single value "1234" all the time. I can test this out on cyberchef by
generating a 1234 hash on the sha3 256 algorithm.

1d6442ddcfd9db1ff81df77cbefcd5afcc8c7ca952ab3101ede17a84b866d3f3

this is the output. This doesnt match because I reloaded the page and clicked on the display
secret ID which gave me a new hashed number. This was not hash(1234) but a hash of another
number. Currently the hashed number is 1246 according to the viewed page source:

82c0601da343ae5e34edeff821c869e7b1106c4fa354736cff1cfa7fbe02ba16

After trying with cyberchef I get:

43065d19127ac71dfdd495ef9baebdbb0f55336f10431b077d6b6329edbd38d1

This doesnt match with the viewed source because when I viewed it the hashed number changed
so the actual number that was hashed was actually 1245 which is:

82c0601da343ae5e34edeff821c869e7b1106c4fa354736cff1cfa7fbe02ba16

The submit id according to the sourced ID is disabled on html. I can bypass this by inspecting
After bypassing and submitting, I am greeted with a Forbidden page:

"""
Forbidden

You don't have the permission to access the requested resource. It is either read-protected 
or not readable by the server.
"""

There seems to be set cookies. The cookie I have right now is a session cookie (N.B. none 
of these have a \n seperating them):

session=.eJwlzjkSAjEMBMC_OCbQZdnez2z5kBYCkj0iir9joCaaqQn6FVbf7biH5dwvu4X1McISXIg7DyDVRg
WpJK-1EcT6nS0jDGmcqmllEI7GuSOASnROHWl-krbsMyCOYMjDZQj0kaFoKayeW88KAkXcqThSNXBMDA0tTMjz2H4Yp
EizXoftf9x22XGG9wcboTSe.ZsT6sw.-YMzYv6RFXW3A_ZlXfzu7vBu38Y

It seems after I refresh, the cookie changes:

session=.eJwlzjkSAjEMBMC_OCbQZdnez2z5kBYCkj0iir9joCaaqQn6FVbf7biH5dwvu4X1McISXIg7DyDVRg

MizXoftf9x22XGG9wcbtjSf.ZsT7pQ.iEAUzylfm5tL3Ip61OX6e7KB-X4

after refreshing once more, the cookie changes again:

session=.eJwlzjkSAjEMBMC_OCbQZdnez2z5kBYCkj0iir9joCaaqQn6FVbf7biH5dwvu4X1McISXIg7DyDVRg

CizXoftf9x22XGG9wcbyzSg.ZsT8Rw.rop3Pu9aFMK2Ae-5i_iYTg8Wk9U

Analyzing them I see that for the most part they look the same but the last bit changes.
I assume this might be related to the changed secretID after its hashed but I dont know for
sure. Looking at burp whenever I refresh the /send a a file of what seems to be javascript
gets executed. The file is located at /static/js-sha3. So it goes that whenever a GET 
request is sent to /send, another following GET request is sent to /static/js-sha3. I 
assume this is part of what encrypts the secret ID but theres already javascript for it
on the /send page. I download the /static/js-sha3 file by going to that url direclly.

Another thing is that on the source viewed /send page there is a message from the dev
saying:

"""
FIXME: Hack to show people what the secret ID will be after they send their message. It _usually_
works, but sometimes it doesn't, if someone takes too long to write their message.
The real way to fix this is to better explain that they need to actually finish writing
their message before they can get the link.
If they really need the link inside the message, for some reason, we should just add
the ability to edit a message after saving it.
"""

I dont quite understand what this means yet.

While going through the website, I found that on one of news articles /new/7, there
was a url to a secret message:

/message/67b176705b46206614219f47a05aee7ae6a3edbe850bbbe214c536b989aea4d2

the page reads:

"""
Secret message example
From: admin

Our servers support sending secret messages between users.

Using state-of-the-art, SHA3-256 encryption, we ensure that only the 
intended recipient can ever access your messages.

Even better, because our technology is so safe, you can use it to send messages to 
people who don't even have accounts on the site. Simply write your message and copy 
the sharing link. Anyone with that can read the message, but no one would be able to 
guess it, even if they had a powerful supercomputer.
"""

The above url looks like one of those encrypted sha3 hashes. Maybe I can try to
match and see which number it matches to. Judging from the hashed inputs on the 
secret IDit looks as though the hashed numbers have to be 4 digits (0000 to 9999).

So after making a script that does that matches the numbers I found that the 
hashed text on the url matches with the number 1. This tells me that there may 
be more secret messages with different hashed values. This worked doing it with
hashed numbers 2, 3, etc. There was one that seemed to be inaccessible. I tried 
to access the url without being logged in to see if the cookie thing or url thing
mattered, but I dont think it did as I could access the message url without entering
any credentials even after I restarted my machine. I am not sure however since there 
are session cookies still. I am going to try writing a python script that does
all this and retrieves the data from each page so that I can automate rather than 
brute forcing by hand.

The script I made is basically supposed to go through the hashed number message
urls of the first 50 (arbitrary, set by me, might need to bump it up) and output 
the body portion of the web pages. There were some 404 not found pages so I had the
program skip through those and store in a list. Heres the output of the program:
